一个方便自己使用的小应用，ocr识别屏幕+tts语音朗读，可以满足那些有中文字幕但懒得看电影只想听对话的场景，后续可能会加上ai识图和ai朗读，但是目前来看ai方案的延迟还是不太能接受

This is a small app for my own convenience. It uses OCR to recognize the screen and TTS to read the dialogue aloud. It's perfect for those who want to listen to the dialogue but don't want to watch the movie because there are Chinese subtitles. I might add AI image recognition and AI reading aloud later, but the latency of the AI ​​solution is still unacceptable at the moment.
